## 1. Sprint refinement meetings
This is a weekly scrum of scrums with component leads and WP leads held on thursday afternoon.<br />
A cross-component issue having to be discussed during this weekly sprint refinement meeting has to be pushed to the " Soilwise Sprint refinement" project.<br />
This can be done in a similar way as described in "6. Pushing issue to 'Soilwise Project Backlog' and further describing issue".<br />
After pushing the issue/task to the "Soilwise Sprint Refinement" go to the project and move the issue to the "To Discuss" column in the Kanban board.

## 2. Sprint planning
TBD - we are still experimenting in finding a workable approach.  

Currnet approach:

First stage:
  - “major” sprint planning with WP & TC leads -> define high-level/larger requirements (issues) to be dealt with in coming month
  - list issues in Soilwise-Project-Backlog 
  - deadline first sprint planning: 26/04
<br />
<br />

Second stage:
  - “micro” sprint planning per development team/technical component
  - refine issues in Soilwise-Project-Backlog to smaller/specific tasks the developers will work on in coming month
  - list issues in projects for specific technical component
  - push "major" issues to Soilwise-Project-Backlog
