work in progress!!

any questions or comments related to this documentation, please provide as 'issue' and it will be looked at and integrated into documentation


## 4 aspects to be used for backlog
- _Repository_: contains issues and discussions, one or more repositories per technical component (pragmatic approach)
- _Issue_ (within repository): use as measurable task/ticket to breakdown requirement, preferably with acceptance criteria
- _Discussion_ (within repository): more a concept/ an aspect that has to be discussed for future development; when becoming more scoped/tangible, set up new issue and refer to discussion to keep issue (ticket) clean
- _Project_: monitor and plan tasks a development team is working on in view of a technical component
