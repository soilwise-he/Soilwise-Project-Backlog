We distinguish between data and knowledge from persistent sources and non-persistent assets. Exceptions could be made in specific cases, such as when the persistence of high value data/knowledge assets could otherwise not be guaranteed (see 3.1 Storage strategy, at D7.2 Open Science and Data Management Plan) Also, Based on D1.3 Repository architecture. v1 6.       SoilWise Repository will provide data download in two modes, “as is” or in an “interoperable way”. “As is” means the SWR is a broker connecting a user to a relevant data source. The “interoperable way” means the SWR is a mediator that converts external data into, e.g. INSPIRE compliant through an ETL-like tool, e.g. HALE Studio.	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                   |             |               |                                    |

Requirements, v1 D1.1 it is not very clear if  the result of A Soil Deal for Europe’ will be included in data search. It is referred at the EUSO. “While benefiting from the outcomes of the Mission ‘A Soil Deal for Europe’, EUSO will ensure the legacy of knowledge and data produced by the Mission. In this context, SoilWise primarily focuses on enhancing the technical infrastructure supporting EUSO’s activities, and will develop and test a prototype for an open access, user friendly long term knowledge and data repository, taking due account of the requirements emerging from the evolvement of the EUSO. After the project lifecycle, SoilWise Repository will be integrated and further developed and maintained by EUSO”	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                   |             |               |                                    |

But also I see in the description for the Functionality for first version of the Repository prototype that: SoilWise Repository will enable user to manually upload data for their on-the-fly processing within the SWR. Capacity of the SWR will be significantly limited; however, a demonstration of manual data upload and their processing, e.g. transformation of coordinate systems or measurements units. Whats the meaning of this functionality, especialy the given limited Capacity? Will it store data or it will be used as a data processing interface? **Leonidas Liakos**: SWR will keep metadata that point to source datasets and it will ensure if these sources are alive.   **Marc Van Liedekerke**: Is the repository really going to store data?"	 |                   |             |               |                                    |

If this is not possible because the SoilWise project has not started yet, SoilWise is asked to suggest a temporary solution to support the achievement of this objective, like Zenodo or similar. 	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 	                                       | 	                        | **Panos Panagos**: However, an early development of a first versionof the catalogue may take place in midle 2024.	                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                   |             |               |                                    |

| 39	 | EUSO, ESDAC & SoilWIse             | SoilWise should consider that the main target group of EUSO consists of the policymakers. Policymakers want to know:  - Where is the problem (this needs data)? - What can we do about it? (needs knowledge) - Is what we are doing making a difference? (needs monitoring and data) - Are things getting better? (needs monitoring) - What are the consequences of the (proposed or implemented) action, e.g., trade-offs and costs?
